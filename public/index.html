                <p><strong>In towns and cities across the world, the colour of night is changing. Traditional yellow sodium street lights are steadily being replaced by white LED bulbs. The new lights use less energy, dramatically cutting carbon emissions and saving money. But not everybody is happy.</strong></p>
                <p>"When the leaves left the trees and I tried to sleep, I turned to one side and the light's shining right
                    in my eyes."</p>
                <p>Like most of us, Karen Snyder had never really paid much attention to street lights. But that all changed
                    last year when the city council began installing LED lights outside her home in a quiet corner of Washington
                    DC.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to the light shining into her bedroom, the 63-year-old teacher's guest room, where she watches
                    TV, is now bathed in something akin to strong moonlight.</p>
                <p>"It's like there's a ray coming in. Like a blue ray. Right directly on to the couch. If you are sitting down,
                    the moon would be above the house and you'd get the beautiful feel of the moon. This is shining right
                    in your eyes so it's pretty different than a moon. Moons don't go this low into the windows."</p>
                <p>Her friend, Delores Bushong, says her sleep has also been disturbed by the LED street lights outside her
                    home, and is now one of the main opponents of the new lighting in the city. She fears they will ruin
                    the atmosphere on her back porch, where she likes to relax after dark in a hammock in the sweltering
                    summer months.</p>
                <p>"In some kinds of torture they put a light on someone's face all the time," she says. "Am I going to be subjected
                    to a kind of torture forever? It doesn't make sense to me. Just because we have a new technology and
                    you can save money."</p>
                <p>Bushong has become well-versed in the jargon of colour temperature (measured in Kelvins) and light intensity
                    (measured in Lumens), as she battles to get the city to take her concerns seriously. At the very least,
                    she wants the 4,000-Kelvin bulbs in her neighbourhood, which she compares to the harsh lighting in a
                    prison yard, to be replaced by bulbs with lower Kelvin ratings, closer in look and feel to the old high-intensity
                    sodium bulbs.</p>
                <p>The city insists it is listening to her campaign group's concerns but there is no turning back the march
                    of the LEDs.</p>
                <p>"There are many reasons why cities are switching to LED lights," says Seth Miller Gabriel, the director of
                    Washington DC's Office of Public Private Partnerships.</p>
                <p>"One, not be looked over, is cost - 50% or more over the life cycle of this new light. The lights last a
                    lot longer. So we save electricity, by at least 50%, we save on the maintenance costs and we get a better
                    lighting solution."</p>
                <p>Then there are the environmental benefits: "We estimate that in the District of Columbia by switching our
                    71,000 street lights over to LEDs we can save upwards of 30 million pounds (13,600 tonnes) of coal a
                    year, in electricity we won't be using for the lights," he says.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Miller Gabriel argues that many city-dwellers are blundering around in neighbourhoods that have never been
                    properly lit, allowing crime to fester in the shadows. He dreams of a world where every street light
                    is an LED. He may live long enough to see that happen.</p>
                <p>About 10% of America's street lights have so far been converted, but the Department of Energy has estimated
                    that if the whole country switched to LEDs over the next two decades it would save $120bn over that 20-year
                    period.
                </p>
                <p>Cities across Europe and the Asia Pacific region are going down the LED route and, in China, the central
                    planning agency is in the middle of a conversion programme it expects will cut annual carbon emissions
                    by 48 million tonnes.</p>
                <p>Against these sort of statistics, those campaigning against LEDs can sound like Luddites, railing against
                    scientific progress, but they insist they have a strong case.</p>
                <p>They point to a recent report by the American Medical Association (AMA), which warns that the blue light
                    emitted by first generation high-intensity LEDs, used in many cities around the world including New York,
                    can adversely affect circadian sleep rhythms, leading to reduced duration and quality of sleep, "impaired
                    daytime functioning" and obesity.</p>
                <p>The AMA report calls on cities to use the lowest-intensity LEDs possible and shade them better to reduce
                    glare, which it warns can also harm wildlife.</p>

            <div class="list">
                <li>Light emitting diodes - or LEDs - first appeared as red lights in pocket calculators and digital watches
                    in the 1960s</li>
                <li>Now white LEDs are used in everything from car headlights to camera flashes and home lighting</li>
                <li>The first LED street lights were rated 4,000 Kelvin or higher on the temperature chart used to describe colour</li>
                <li>The latest LEDs have lower Kelvin ratings and produce a softer, amber light and less potentially harmful
                    blue light</li>
                <li>They are are up to 50% more energy-efficient than traditional yellow sodium lights and last for up 20 years,
                    instead of two to five</li>

            <div class="news_content1">
                <p>Seth Miller Gabriel says the report does not contain original research and is "more of a literature review
                    of what's been published elsewhere".</p>
                <p>"We would really like to see more concrete evidence of what's going on with these lights," he says. "If it's
                    really a problem, based on a particular intensity of lights, we want to know that. That AMA report really
                    didn't give us the kind of hard data we would need [on which] to base a large scale procurement."</p>
                <p>He is overseeing the tendering process for the next phase of Washington's LED conversion which he promises
                    will be done in a more sensitive way, with lower Kelvin ratings, better shading and remote controls,
                    so that lights can be dimmed or increased in intensity at different times to suit the needs of particular
                    neighbourhoods.
                </p>
                <p>But he adds: "Let's be honest, humans are not engineered for change. So when we come home and see a different
                    light. Even if it's a much better light, there's going to be a reaction - 'Oh my goodness, it's a different
                    light, what happened?'"</p>
                <p>It is true that many of the same arguments being made against LED lights were heard in the early 1970s, when
                    cities were converting to the yellow sodium lights we are so familiar with today.</p>

                <p>High-intensity sodium bulbs used less energy than the mercury vapour bulbs they replaced. But some campaigners,
                    most notably a Vancouver-based artist called Ralf Kelman, argued at the time that their "antiseptic orange"
                    glow was too bright and would damage growth in young trees, as well as blocking out the stars in the
                    night sky.</p>
                <p>The light pollution argument has also been used against LEDs, although <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22292129">some researchers say that properly directed</a></strong>,
                    they could dramatically improve the visibility of stars.</p>
                <p>But, for some people, the debate goes beyond dry arguments about Kelvin ratings, light pollution and carbon
                    emissions and touches on questions about the quality of life city-dwellers should expect.</p>
                <p>"When the lighting is right you have a sense of peace and contemplation, of aesthetic joy in the world,"
                    says novelist Lionel Shriver, who is campaigning against LEDs in the South Brooklyn neighbourhood where
                    she spends part of the year.</p>
                <p>"I am not someone who believes she can stand in the way of the march of the LEDs. The savings in energy are
                    too great. The savings in money are too great. And if we just say 'but it's not pretty' that's not going
                    to stop these things.</p>
                <p>"The truth is that the technology of LEDs has advanced fantastically so that it is no longer necessary to
                    make a stark choice between economy and the environment and aesthetics. You can have both.</p>
                <p>"What is going on in some cities, in New York especially, that is what I am most familiar with, amounts to
                    a kind of widespread civic vandalism."</p>
